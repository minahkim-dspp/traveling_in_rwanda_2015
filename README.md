## Executive Summary

## About the Project
### Context of the Project
How does food arrive on our table? In the world of globalization, food often travels across the globe through multiple transactions among intermediaries. For the food produced by small farmers, they first travel with the farmers to the city to be in the market. However, traveling to a city is not free. The longer it takes for the farmers to travel, the higher the travel cost. In addition, the higher the cost of traveling, the lower the price competitiveness in the market, as the farmer needs to sell at a higher price to cover the travel expenses. The same applies to the buyers. If you have to travel long distances to buy crops from the market, it may be cheaper for them to cultivate the crop by themselves. As a result, the time of traveling to the nearest city is a factor of interest to policymakers who work with smallholder farmers.
    
In 2020, more than 76% of the Rwandan population depended on subsidence farming as a major source of income ([Weatherspoon et al., 2021](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/jafio-2021-0011/html)). In other words, 76% of Rwandans farm to self-feed themselves rather than get involved in the food market. Although self-sustainable farming can be resilient to external shock, it usually produces less profit than selling the same product in the food market. When you glimpse the map of Rwanda, you may think that transportation is not a great hurdle in participating in the food market since it is a small country where you can easily travel from one end of a country to another in a day. However, Rwanda is called **the land of a thousand hills**. This mountainous country has an elevation that ranges from 1000m to 4500m ([U.S. Embassy in Rwanda](https://rw.usembassy.gov/embassy/kigali/agencies-offices/geography/)). These hills could be one of the many reasons that transportation time between the two points may not be proportional to the distance on the map in Rwanda.
  
This data visualization illustrates the relationship between the distance to the nearest city and the time it takes for the people to travel to the nearest city using the 2015 AreNA data from IFPRI. For researchers who have never worked with Rwanda before, it aims to provide the initial overview of the complicated relationship between the travel time and the distance in Rwanda.

All the data comes from the [AreNA's DHS-GIS Database](https://www.ifpri.org/publication/arenas-dhs-gis-database) by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). The data is under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International, which allows to "reuse, distribute, and reproduce content even for commercial purposes" under the condition to "contain attribution of the content to IFPRI and any named authors of the dataset".

The shapefiles were the "Second-level Administrative Dvision, Rwanda, 2015" and "Fourth-level Administrative Dvision, Rwanda, 2015", produced by Robert J. Hijamans and the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology of the University of California, Berkeley. I fetch the two shapefiles from the Web Feature Services (WFS) distributed by Stanford University. The shapefiles are "freely available for academic use and other non-commercial use" and can be used "to create maps and use the data in other ways for publication in academic journals, books, reports, etc" ([Hijmans & University of California, Berkeley](https://earthworks.stanford.edu/catalog/stanford-qy869sx9298).
